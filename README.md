# Moviedb For Arctouch

Basically I used
Facebook libraries, firebase, apache, apache mail.

Facebook: Used for login with facebook

Firebase: for user registration

Apache and Mail: for API communication
(request hTTP and send mail, where mail did not need to be used since I switched to using email sending with firebase).

Gson of Google: Used for read json

SmartImageView: To make it easier to work with images
